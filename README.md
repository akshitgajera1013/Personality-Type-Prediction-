# Personality-Type-Prediction

# 🧠 Personality Type Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts a person's personality type based on behavioral and lifestyle traits using a Machine Learning model.
The model is built using **Logistic Regression** and deployed using **Streamlit** for an interactive user interface.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This ML model classifies personality types into 3 categories based on various psychological and behavioral features such as:
- Social Energy
- Talkativeness
- Leadership
- Risk Taking
- Planning
- Adventurousness
- And more...

The application allows users to adjust trait values using sliders and get real-time personality predictions.
